# Contributor Code of Conduct — NEXUS - IXP-137 CORE

The **IXP-137 CORE** project is an experimental research environment.  
All participants are expected to maintain a respectful, safe, and focused
collaboration space.

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within GitHub issues,
pull requests, discussions, and community spaces.


## 1. Purpose

This project is built on:
- curiosity  
- scientific experimentation  
- technical exploration  
- mutually respectful communication  

The Code of Conduct exists to protect contributors and maintain clarity around
what this project *is* and *is not*.


## 2. Expected Behavior

Contributors must:
- Show respect toward others  
- Provide constructive feedback  
- Stay on-topic and focused on technical content  
- Assume good intentions, but maintain clarity and precision  
- Follow the **IXP-137 Experimental Research License (ERL-1.0)**  
- Respect that the project is *not* an operational hazard-warning system  
- Accept that discussions must remain technical, not ideological

Clear, concise, and factual communication is expected.


## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following are strictly prohibited:
- Harassment, insults, personal attacks  
- Spamming, trolling, or derailing technical discussions  
- Fearmongering or using the project to claim real-world danger  
- Misrepresenting the project as a forecasting or emergency tool  
- Posting misinformation as “scientific fact”  
- Sharing or discussing real-world disasters in an alarming or sensational way  
- Attempting to use the system output for hazard warnings to the public  

Any of the above will result in removal from participation.


## 4. Reporting Violations

To report violations of this Code of Conduct:
- Open a **private** GitHub report using “Report Abuse”
- Provide evidence (logs, links, screenshots)
- The maintainer will review and take appropriate action

Do **not** open a public issue for sensitive conflict reports.


## 5. Enforcement

The project maintainers have full authority to:
- warn contributors  
- moderate discussions  
- close issues  
- reject or revert contributions  
- permanently ban individuals who violate the Code of Conduct  

All decisions are final.


## 6. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All GitHub repositories under the IXP-137 umbrella  
- All discussions, issues, comments, documentation, and code reviews  
- Any community interaction related to the project  

Indirect references (e.g. using the name externally) are also included.


## 7. Disclaimer

This project is experimental.  
Any misrepresentation — accidental or deliberate — is treated as a violation.

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to maintain a space where:
- experimentation is safe  
- contributors feel respected  
- no one attempts to misuse the project for real-world hazard communication

Thank you for helping build a responsible research environment.
